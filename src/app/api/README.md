# API Routes

Next.js App Router API routes. Most business logic lives in tRPC routers at `src/server/routers/` — these REST routes handle cases where tRPC is not suitable (file uploads, webhooks, cron jobs, NextAuth).

## Route Groups

### `auth/`
Custom authentication endpoints alongside NextAuth. Handles credential login, registration, and the forgot/reset password flow with rate limiting.

### `cron/`
Vercel Cron Job endpoints. All are GET handlers that verify `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` in production. `test-reminder` is blocked in production.

### `payments/`
File upload support for payment receipts. Returns an S3 presigned URL; the client uploads directly to S3 (avoids routing large files through Vercel).

### `policies/`
PDF generation for protecciones. Streams the generated PDF as a response.

### `trpc/`
Single catch-all route that mounts the tRPC app router (`src/server/routers/_app.ts`). All tRPC procedures are served here.

### `user/`
Avatar upload presigned URL. Supports both authenticated sessions and invitation-token-based access (for onboarding).

### `webhooks/`
Stripe webhook receiver. Verifies signature, processes payment events (`payment_intent.succeeded`, etc.), and updates payment/policy state.
