- We use bun, so you can check the build with `bun run build`
- Remember this is a brand new project not yet deployed, we don't care about data migration nor about backwards compatibility
- When looking at ENUMs or data that is both on the codebase and on the schema, remember to use always the schema, if there is a conflict always ask for clarification
- Remember the primary landlord is then one with `isPrimary` set to true, do not rely on the index
